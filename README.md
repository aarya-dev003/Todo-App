# Todo App

This is a simple Todo app built using Android Jetpack Compose and Room database. It follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern for better separation of concerns.

## Features

- Add, edit, and delete Todo items.
- Mark Todo items as completed.
- View a list of all Todo items.

## Tech Stack

- **Jetpack Compose**: Modern UI toolkit for building native Android apps in Kotlin.
- **Room Database**: Persistence library that provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow for more robust database access.
- **ViewModel**: Part of the Android Architecture Components that is responsible for managing UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way.
- **MVVM Architecture**: Separation of concerns pattern that divides the app into three main components: Model, View, and ViewModel.
